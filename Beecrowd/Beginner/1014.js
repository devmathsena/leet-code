/*
Calculate a car's average consumption being provided the total distance traveled (in Km) and the 
spent fuel total (in liters).

Input
The input file contains two values: one integer value X representing the total distance (in Km) and the second one 
is a floating point number Y  representing the spent fuel total, with a digit after the decimal point.

Output
Present a value that represents the average consumption of a car with 3 digits after the decimal point, followed by 
the message "km/l".
